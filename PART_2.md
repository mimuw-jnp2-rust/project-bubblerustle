# PART 2
In this part, I created a wrapper for menu, added rewards, scores, and splash logo at the start of a game.
Unfortunately, I haven't added new guns, bubbles, levels etc.
There could be some bugs in the game also.

## INSPIRATION:

## USE:
```cargo run ```
You play with arrows and shoot hook with space.
