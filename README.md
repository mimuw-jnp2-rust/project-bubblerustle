## Plan
In the first part we're going to implement the most important things: player movement, bubble physics and shooting. The bubbles will double/triple/quadruple and change size after being shot. There will be only one level for only on player.

In the second part we're going to add random level generator, scores and timer. In addition to this there will be two player mode, obstacles or different guns.

## Libraries
- Bevy
- maybe more
