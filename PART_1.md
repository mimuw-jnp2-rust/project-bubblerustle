# PART 1
In this part, I created a basic physics for bubbles, player and hook. Now you can play a simple game without menu and notifications.
I didn't create a mechanics for bubbles to triple/quadruple. 
In the second part, the game will have all the bells and whistles, like levels, menu, scores etc.
